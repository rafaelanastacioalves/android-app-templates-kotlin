## Technical Description

I used the following libraries:
- **Retrofit 2:**: :

- **Coroutines**: :

- **Jetpack Compose**: : 

- **Android Architecture Components**: : 


## Tests

The tests use the `instrumentation` build type to run because we force the app to point to `localhost` during the tests.
(Currently unstable due to the migration to Jetpack Compose)
