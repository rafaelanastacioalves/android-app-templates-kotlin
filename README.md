## General Description

A template that uses concepts and technologies learned by me.

In this current branch the app keeps listing new numbers each second. Clicking in one of them should show a simple generic detail screen with no much information.

## Technical Description

I used the following libraries:
- **Retrofit 2:**: :

- **Coroutines**: :

- **Jetpack Compose**: :

- **Jetpack Navigation**: :

- **Android Architecture Components**: :

- **Coil**: :

- **Flow**: :


## Tests

The tests use the `instrumentation` build type to run because we force the app to point to `localhost` during the tests.
(Currently unstable due to the migration to Jetpack Compose)
